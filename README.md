## About the Project

This project is based on The [Odin Project: Authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication). we built an exclusive clubhouse where the members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

We created User and Post model, controllers, dabatase and views with mainly three useful gems such as devise gem, devise-bootstrap-views gem and gravatar_image_tag gem. Plus, we are using Bootstrap to organize layouts and all other views.

A list of commonly used resources that we find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
